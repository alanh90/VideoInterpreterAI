![FractalNet Logo](videointerpreter_ai.png)

This Streamlit-based application integrates computer vision and AI to analyze and understand video content. It uses OpenAI's powerful GPT-4 API to generate descriptive text for video sequences, offering a glimpse into the content and context of the videos.

## Features

- **Video Upload**: Users can upload videos in MP4, AVI, or MOV formats.
- **Frame Display**: The application displays the first frame of the uploaded video.
- **Automated Description**: Leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 to generate descriptions for the video content.

## How to Use

1. Upload a video file using the Streamlit file uploader.
2. Wait as the app processes the video and displays the first frame.
3. Read the generated description of the video content.

## Technical Details

- The app saves the video to a temporary file for processing.
- Frames are extracted and converted to base64 for analysis.
- Descriptions are generated by sending frames to the OpenAI API.
- The first frame of the video and its description are displayed on the UI.
